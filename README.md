This website was built for my uncle&rsquo;s ski camp. Users can get info about the camp and register.

## Development Setup

Before you do anything, you&rsquo;ll need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

```shell
# clone
git clone https://github.com/cadejscroggins/willycamp.com
cd willycamp.com

# install
npm i

# serve
npm start
```

The site should be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
